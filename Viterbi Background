What is the Viterbi Algorithm? 
The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that allows us to compute the most probable path or the most likely sequence of hidden states that results in a sequnce of observed events.

The Viterbi Algorithm is a more efficint method of solving similar problems that can be solved using a Hidden Markov Model. 
Hidden Markov Models are used to compute the most likely sequence of unobservable states that result in the observed state we see. The unobservable states are called hidden states.

In a Hidden Markov Model there are transition probabilities which are the probabilities of a hidden state based on another hidden state. 
Each hidden state then has an affect on the observed state and the probabilitty of observing an observed state given a hidden state is called the emission probability.

The Hidden Markov Model should seem brute force. Inefficient is another word. 
The Viterbi algorithm is what solves the Hidden Markov Model's straightforwardness and makes that process more efficient.
